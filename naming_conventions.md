# General Notes

## Naming conventions and cases

---

### camelCase

camelCase is a writing style where multiple words are joined `without spaces` and each word `starts with a capital` letter. But the first word starts with a lowercase letter

For example:

#### howAreYou

#### markdownFormat

#### itWorksOnMyMachine

#### goOrRust

Notice how the first letter of every word starts with a lowercase letter. Camel case is most oftenly used for two letter words. Some programming langauges like `Java` and `Dart` require variables to follow the camelCase naming convention

---

### snake_case

snake_case is a naming style where words are lowercase and separated by underscores, with no spaces or punctuation

For example:

#### how_are_you

#### markdown_format

#### it_works_on_my_machine

#### go_or_rust

There is no punctuation and everything is lowercase, spaces are replaced by underscores. In python variables are required to follow the snake_case naming convention.

***Tip: When naming Folders or Files on your local machine use snake_case***

`Constant` variables are required to follow the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE naming convention where your variable is written in snake case but every char is also uppcase. (like snake_case but everything is uppercase)

For example:

#### THIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE_CONSTANT

#### HOW_ARE_YOU

#### GO_OR_RUST

---

### PascalCase

PascalCase (also called ***UpperCamelCase***) is a naming style where multiple words are joined with ***no separators, and the first letter of every word is capitalized, including the first one***.

For example:

#### HowAreYou

#### Markdown

#### ItWorksOnMyMachine

#### GoOrRust

If you are working in a langauge where PascalCase is the standard naming convension, then you are more than likeley working in the wrong langauge.
Delphi follows the PascalCase naming convention for naming variables.
